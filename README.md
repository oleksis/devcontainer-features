# Development Container Features

'Features' are self-contained units of installation code and development container configuration. Features are designed to install on top of wide range of based container images (**this repository focuses on `ubuntu` based images**).

## Usages

To use a feature from this repository add the corresponding feature to a `devcontainer.json`. Each feature has a `README.md` file autogenerated from the corresponding feature's `devcontainer-feature.json`. The file lists the available options for the feature.

The example below installs the `python-launcher` [Python launcher for Unix](https://python-launcher.app) feature declared in the [src](./src) folder of this repository. See the relevant feature's `README.md` for supported options.

```jsonc
{
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/oleksis/devcontainer-features/python-launcher:1": {}
    }
}
```

```bash
$ py --help

Python Launcher for Unix 1.0.0
usage: py [launcher-args] [python-args]
...
```
